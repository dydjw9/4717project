Assassin (also Gotcha, Assassins, KAOS (Killing as organized sport), Juggernaut, Battle Royal, Paranoia, Killer, Elimination, or Circle of Death) is a live-action game. Players try to eliminate each other from the game using mock weapons in an effort to become the last surviving player.

Assassin is particularly popular on college campuses; several universities have a dedicated "Assassins' Guild" society, which organizes games for their members. Game play occurs at all hours and in all places unless otherwise disallowed by the rules.[1] Since an elimination attempt could occur at any time, successful players are obliged to develop a healthy degree of watchful paranoia.
