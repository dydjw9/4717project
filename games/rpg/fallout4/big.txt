Fallout 4 is an upcoming open world action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. The game will be the fifth major installment in the Fallout series, and will be released worldwide on November 10, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.[4]

200 years after a nuclear war, Fallout 4 is set in a post-apocalyptic Boston, in which the player character emerges from an underground bunker known as a Vault. Gameplay will be similar to Fallout 3. Completing quests and acquiring experience will level up the character, allowing for new abilities. With an optional first- or third-person view, players can explore Fallout 4‍ '​s open world setting at will, allowing nonlinear gameplay. Additional party members can accompany the player, who will assist them in battles. Players have the ability to construct and deconstruct buildings and items, and use them to build a settlement, which can attract and be inhabited by non-playable characters.
