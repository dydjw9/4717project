Skyrim, also known as the Old Kingdom, the Fatherland or Keizaal (Dovahzul: KEiZAaL Keiz-Aal, "Rebellion-May"[note 1]), is a vast region set in the northern part of Tamriel.[1] It is home to the Nords, large and hardy men and women who have a strong resistance to frost, both natural and magical.[1][2] Skyrim was originally inhabited by a race of Mer known as the Snow Elves, though after the Atmoran-Snow Elf War, the Snow Elves were destroyed and the Atmorans settled the land.[3] It is bordered by Morrowind to the east, Cyrodiil to the south, Hammerfell to the southwest, and High Rock to the west. The island of Solstheim lies to the northeast of Skyrim.
